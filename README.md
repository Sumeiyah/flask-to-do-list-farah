1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-manager-app.git
    cd task-manager-app
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```bash

    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

- `/delete/<int:id>`: Deletes a task with the specified ID.
- `/update/<int:id>`: Displays the form to update the details of a task.
